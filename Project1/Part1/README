Project Description: Group F part 1 of the project 1 creates a program to build a doubly linked list and apply a custom quicksort algorithm to sort and print the results.

Group Member's Contributions:
	Jeff Barto: 33.33%
	Alisha Bansal: 33.33%
	Mario Muscarella: 33.33%

Compiling Instruction: A makefile is included in the working directory. So, running the 'make' command in the 'Group_F/part1' directory will compile all relevant files into an executable named 'main'. The program can then be run by specifying './main'

A sample test run: 
	spirit:~/Group_F/part1% ./main 
	Enter list data: 
	30
	20
	50
	70
	10
	0
	List before sort: 
	30 20 50 70 10 
	List after sort: 
	10 20 30 50 70 

Existing Bugs: There are no KNOWN bugs.
