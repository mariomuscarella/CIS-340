Project Description: Group F part 1 of the project 1 creates a program to build a doubly linked list 
and apply a custom quicksort algorithm to sort and print the results.


Compiling Instruction: A makefile is included in the working directory. So, running the 'make' command in the 
'part1' directory will compile all relevant files into an executable named 'main'. 
The program can then be run by specifying './main'

A sample test run: 
	spirit:~/Group_F/part1% ./main 
	Enter list data: 
	30
	20
	50
	70
	10
	0
	List before sort: 
	30 20 50 70 10 
	List after sort: 
	10 20 30 50 70 

Existing Bugs: There are no KNOWN bugs.
